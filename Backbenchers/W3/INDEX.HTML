            <p style="background-color:lightblue ;"> Turn to the left! Strange fascination, fascinating me. In this age of grand illusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams. Look at those cavemen go. Don't kid yourself they belong to you, they're the start of a coming race. He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. Never look back, walk tall, act fine. I never thought I'd need so many people. If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself. They're travelling the holy land opening telegrams. Sue, the clinic called; the x-ray's fine. Pale blinds drawn all day. The far side of town, where the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground. Do you remember, the bills you have to pay? Dignity is valuable, but our lives are valuable too. He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style. He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do. I'm an alligator. Sometimes I feel the need to move on; so I pack a bag and move on. If she says she can do it, then she can do it, she don't make false claims. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? He was awful nice — really quite out of sight. Wake up in the wrong town, boy you really get around. So I said 'So long', and I waved 'Bye-bye'. Far out! It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect. I'm afraid of Americans. Life rolls into one for them. I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. We believe in you. I'm glad that you're older than me. Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever. Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright! </p>

            <p style="background-color: yellow ;">If you stay you won't be sorry. Have you sought fortune evasive and shy? I watch the ripples change their size, but never leave the stream. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about — watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!". They don't dig anything. The return of the Thin White Duke. Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and disgrace. You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it. I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? Tell my wife I love her very much. It's a moving world, but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles. He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. We must have died alone, a long long time ago. Throwing darts in lovers' eyes. I kissed a lot of people that day. He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style. Don't kid yourself they belong to you, they're the start of a coming race. He treats you well and makes you up real fine. Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom. I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. I can stare for a thousand years. You're such a wonderful person — but you got problems. It's War-hol, actually. The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone. Yes we're lovers, and that is that. Hey, that's far out so you heard him too! Look at those cavemen go. The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party. We believe in you. Freak out! </p>
            
            <p>Wake up in the wrong town, boy you really get around. Do you remember, the bills you have to pay? Sometimes I feel the need to move on; so I pack a bag and move on. As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent, you asked for the latest party. I never did anything out of the blue. Don't let the sun blast your shadow. I'm a space invader. We believe in you. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind. He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. I'm glad that you're older than me. So softly a supergod cries. He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do. He treats you well and makes you up real fine. It's War-hol, actually. You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it. If you stay you won't be sorry. I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel. He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom. I've never done good things. If you want it, boys, get it here. I care for no one else but you. Far out! Listen. I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. You're such a wonderful person — but you got problems. He was awful nice — really quite out of sight. We're learning to live with somebody's depression. No death for the perfect men. It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect. </p>
